# ENGR-UH-2310_ADL
Advanced Digital Logic (Mar 2025 - May 2025)
Xilinx Basys2 FPGA, VHDL

### Lab 1: Combinational circuits
Implement a 4-input NAND gate, a half adder, a 4-bit binary adder, minterm operation, and 8:1 MUX. Validate behavior with testbench.

### Lab 2: ALU
Task 1. Write VHDL code to display a 4-bit arithmetic logic unit (ALU) with i/o.
Task 2. Extend User Constraint File (UCF) and detect overflow.

### Lab 3: Counter and FSM
Part 1. Implement hexadecimal and decimal counters on FPGA.
Part 2. Devise a finite state machine (FSM) to implement traffic light controller in VHDL.

### Lab 4: Microprocessor
Task 1. Implement microprocessor in VHDL (decoder, controller, ALU unit, clock cycles, FPGA top-level module, etc.)
Task 2. Test the processor with different opcode and register combinations.
Task 3. Evaluate a given binary program using the processor.
Task 4. Write your own program for the microprocessor.
